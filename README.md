### Hi there 👋

🤭 Funny how I just knew about this cool feature- (having a README first thing in the "Overview" section!) 

## 🍏 Background
Hi! My name is Arwin Lashawn, a biotechnology major from University of California, Davis. I started coding during the summer of 2019. Weirdly enough, I chose to randomly learn about SQL because I thought it looked cool. One thing led to another and I found my passion for programming. I really like the idea of how we are only limited by our creativity when it comes to coding. All you need is a laptop and decent internet connection. : )
